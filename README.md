# Animal Sighting Log API

### Description

To build the API for this application, I began by scaffolding a table for posts.  I used error-driven-development to adjust the controller, routes, model, and serializer for this table.  I tested CRUD actions on the users table and posts table with curl requests.  Once the curl requests returned the expected values and users had correct ownership over their posts, I began building the front-end.
